How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
I decided to create a new hash in the String class, containing the different
available colors. Like this, I think it could be easy to add new available colors
later.
I used this hash with a define_method call, in order to create a method
within the String class for each color.

How long did you spend working on this project?
I have been working on this project for two hours.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I had a difficult time to really understand the concept of metaprogrammming. It was
something I was not used to. I was very happy to see my program working after a few
tries.

Where do you still have room to grow?
As I said earlier, I am just beginning with metaprogrammming. I think for now I am
just seeing the emerged part of the iceberg and I have to go deeper in this.
To sum up, I need to practice more !
